## security governance and compliance

- security governance
    - governance programs: procedures and controls that allow an org to effectively direct its work

- corporate governance
    - corporate governance programs ensure an org sets an appropriate strategic direction, develops a plan to implement that strategy, and executes its plan 
    - done thru hierarchical model 
        - shareholders elect board of directors; board appoints and manages CEO; CEO appoints and manages management team
    - shareholders elect a group (aka board of shareholders) to direct the org's actions on their behalf 
- governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) programs
    - orgs do governance by creating and implementing a GRC program
    - GRC programs integrate:
        - governance of the org 
        - risk management
        - compliance 
    - information security governance
        - CEO delegates infosec responsibility to the CISO (chief information security officer)
        - CISO (+ team) designs and implements an infosec governance framework that guides the activity of the infosec function and ensures alignment 
    - types of governance structures
        - centralized governance models
            - top down approach
            - central authority creates policies and standards 
        - decentralized governance models
            - bottom up approach 
            - individual business units are delegated the authority to achieve cybersecurity objectives in the way they see fit
        - in addition to board directors, SME (subject matter experts) and managers can be incorporated 
- understanding policy documents
    - information security policy framework: series of documents describing org's cybersecurity program 
    - generally include 4 types of docs: policies, standards, procedures, guidelines
    - policies
        - policies are high level statements of management intent 
        - infosec policies usually include:
            - statement of importance of cybersecurity to the org
            - requirements that all staff must protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information / information systems 
            - designating CISO as executive responsible for cybersecurity issues 
            - delegating CISO to have ability to create standards, procedures, and guidelines that implement the policy
        - policy library usually includes:
            - information security policy 
                - provides high level authority and guidance on the security program
            - incident response policy
                - describes how org will respond to security incidents 
            - acceptable use policy
                - provides clear direction on permissible uses of information resources 
            - business continuity and disaster recovery policies 
                - outline procedures and strategies to ensure essential business functions continue during and after a disaster 
            - software development life cycle (SDLC) policy
                - establishes processes and standards for developing and maintaining software
            - change management and change control policies 
                - describe how org will review, approve, and implement proposed changes to information systems 
    - standards
        - standards provide mandatory requirements describing how an org will carry out its infosec policies 
        - ex: specific config settings for an OS; controls for sensitive info
        - 4 types of standards
            - password standards 
            - access control standards
                - describe account life cycle (from provisioning -> active use -> decommissioning)
                - includes specific requirements for personnel and 3rd party contractors 
                - includes credential requirements for devices, service accounts, and root accounts 
            - physical security standards 
                - access control systems, visitor access policies, handling physical security breaches, etc 
            - encryption standards 
                - encryption algos, key mgmt, etc
    - procedures
        - procedures are detailed, step by step processes that people must follow in specific circumstances 
        - ex: procedures for building new systems releasing code to prod, responding to security incidents 
        - common procedures
            - change management procedures 
                - describe how org will perform change management that comply w/ org's change management policy 
            - onboarding / offboarding procedures
                - describe how org will add new user accounts 
                - how how org will remove accounts 
            - playbooks
                - describe actions that incident response team will take when specific incidents occur 
    - guidelines 
        - guidelines provide best practices and recommendations related to a given concept, technology, or task 
        - compliance isn't necessary 
    - exceptions and compensating controls
        - orgs should also provide a mechanism for exceptions to the rules 
        - policy framework should lay out specific requirements for receiving an exception and the individual with the authority to approve exceptions 
        - many exception processes require compensating controls to mitigate risk associated with exceptions 
    - monitoring and revision 
        - with tools like SIEMs, orgs can assess how well policies are being adhered to and whether they still align with current security needs, regulations, and technological changes 
        - when areas for improvement are identified, policy revision becomes necessary 
            - involves updating policies 
            - important to communicate to relevant personnel and necessary training is provided 
- change management 
    - goal of change management is to ensure changes don't cause outages 
    - change mgmt processes ensure appropriate personnel review and approve changes before implementation 
    - change management processes and controls 
        - change mgmt processes ensure personnel can perform a security impact analysis
            - experts evaluate changes to identify security impacts before changes are deployed on prod 
        - change mgmt controls provide a process to control, document, track, and audit all system changes 
        - common change SOP:
            - request the change 
            - review the change 
            - approve / reject change 
            - test change (preferably not on prod)
            - schedule and implement the change 
                - important to have a backout plan 
            - document the change 
        - version control
            - very nice 
        - documentation
            - identifies:
                - current config of systems 
                - system's purpose
                - who is responsible for the system 
                - all changes applied to the baseline 
- personnel mgmt 
    - principle of least privilege 
        -  individuals should be granted minimum set of permissions necessary to carry out their job functions
    -  separation of duties 
        -  usually for extremely sensitive job functions
        -  takes two diff tasks that, when combined, have great sensitivity 
        -  ex: no single person can create a new vendor *and* issue a check 
        -  two person control: similar, but instead of preventing the same person from doing something sensitive, it requires participation of two people to perform a sensitive action 
    -  job rotation and mandatory vacations 
        -  reduces risk of fraud 
        -  job rotation: takes employees with sensitive roles and periodically moves them to other positions
