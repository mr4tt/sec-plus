- CIA triad
	- confidentiality
		- unauthorized individuals can't gain access to sensitive info 
		- eg: firewalls / ACLs / encryption
	- integrity
		- ensure there's no unauthorized modifications to info / systems, either intentionally or unintentionally 
		- eg: hashing / integrity monitoring solutions 
	- availability 
		- ensure info / systems are ready to meet legitimate user needs when they request it 
		- eg: fault tolerance, clustering, backups 
	- nonrepudiation
		- if someone performs an action (eg: sending a msg), they can't deny having taken it 
		- eg: digital signatures
	- security incidents occur when this triad is breached
- DAD triad: 3 key threats to cyber 
	- disclosure
		- exposure of sensitive info to unauthorized individuals
		- aka data loss
		- data exfiltration: when attackers gain access to sensitive info and remove it from the org
	- alteration
		- unauthorized modification of info
		- eg: modifying financial records, solar flare bit flip, typo
	- denial
		- disrupting legitimate user's access to info
		- eg: DDoS, server failure, natural disaster 

- Impacts of breaches
	- financial risk 
	- reputational risk
	- strategic risk
		- risk an org will be less effective in meeting its goals as a result 
		- eg: if competitors gain access to the plans, they could bring competing products to market quickly 
	- operational risk
		- risk to org's ability to carry out day to day functions
	- compliance risk
		- risk to org's compliance to legal / regulatory requirements

- implementing security controls
	- security controls: specific measures will an org take to protect CIA triad
	- control objectives: statements of a desired security state
	- gap analysis
		- during a gap analysis, review control objectives for an org / system / service and examine controls designed to achieve those objectives 
			- gap: when controls do not meet control objective 
	- $\star$ security control categories
		- technical controls
			- ex: ACLs, firewall rules, encryption
		- operational controls
			- ex: user access reviews, log monitoring, vuln management
		- managerial controls
			- ex: risk assessments, security planning exercises, project management practices
		- physical controls
			- ex: fences, locks, alarms
	- $\star$ security control types
		- preventive controls
			- stop security issues before occurring
			- ex: firewalls, encryption
		- deterrent controls
			- prevent attackers from attempting to violate security policies
			- ex: guard dogs, barbed wire
		- detective controls
			- identify security events that have happened
			- ex: intrusion detection systems
		- corrective controls
			- remediate security issues that happened 
			- ex: restoring backups 
		- compensating controls
			- mitigate risk associated with exceptions made to a security policy
			- ex: org needs to use an outdated program, so they put the program in an isolated box
			- PCI DSS (payment card industry data security standard) includes a formal compensating control process; has 3 criteria that has to be met for a compensating control to be satisfactory
				- control must meet intent + rigor of original requirement
				- must provide a similar level of defense as original requirement (enough to offset original risk)
				- control must be "above and beyond" other PCI DSS requirements
		- directive controls 
			- inform employees what to do to achieve security objectives 
			- ex: policies, procedures
- data protection
	- data at rest
	- data in transit
		- data in motion / transit over a network
	- data in use
	- encrypt your data
	- data loss prevention (DLP)
		- data loss prevention systems help orgs enforce info handling policies 
		- these systems search for sensitive info that might be unsecured and monitor network traffic for attempts to remove sensitive info 
		- can block or automatically encrypt traffic w/ sensitive info 
		- agent based DLP 
			- software that searches computers for presence of sensitive info 
			- also monitors system configs and user actions 
		- agentless (network based) DLP
			- dedicated devices that sit on networks and monitor outbound traffic 
		- methods of action:
			- pattern matching
				- ex: blocks anything that is formatted like a credit card # / SSN or has a term like "top secret"
			- watermarking 
				- electronic tabs have previously been applied to sensitive docs and DLP monitoring for those tags
				- commonly used in DRM 
	- data minimization
		- reducing risk by reducing amt of maintained sensitive info 
		- deidentification 
			- removing ability to link data back to an individual
		- data obfuscation
			- transforming data into a format where original info can't be retrieved
			- methods:
				- hashing
				- tokenization
					- replace sensitive values with UID using a lookup table (which needs to also be secure)
				- masking
					- partially redacting sensitive info 
	- access restrictions
		- security measures that limit ability to access sensitive info / resources
		- ex: geographic restrictions
			- ex: only users in a certain country can access a db 
		- ex: permission restrictions
			- limit access to resources based on user's role / level of authorization
	- segmentation
		- places sensitive systems on separate networks 
	- isolation
		- cut off system from access to / from outside networks
