## digital forensics

- digital forensics concepts 
    - digital forensics provides orgs with investigation and analysis tools and techniques to determine what happened on a system
    - legal holds and eDiscovery (electronic discovery)
        - forensics commonly start with litigation is pending or anticipated
        - legal counsel can send a legal hold to notify orgs that they must preserve their data and records 
        - they are usually the first parts of a discovery process, where both sides of a legal case obtain evidence 
            - discovery is also used in FOIA requests 
        - electronic discovery reference model (EDRM) models eDiscovery process
            1. information governance
                - assess what data exists and scope what data needs to be provided
            2. identify information to see what you have and where it is
            3. preserve data
            4. collect data so it can be processed and managed 
            5. process data to remove irrelevant info and prepare it for review and analysis
            6. review data to ensure it only contains what it's supposed to 
            7. analyze data to identify key elements like topics, terms, and individuals / orgs
            8. production of the data to provide the info to 3rd parties / court 
            9. present data for testimony in court and further analysis w/ experts or other parties
        - cloud operations
            - cloud vendors won't let you place a legal hold and discovery agent in their cloud service, so you need to figure out how to deal with legal holds
- conducting digital forensics 
    - acquiring forensic data
        - order of volatility: what data is most likely to be lost due to system operations or normal processes
            - ex, most volatile to least: CPU cache and registers -> routing table, ARP cache, kernel stats -> system memory (RAM) -> temporary files and swap space -> data on hard disk -> remote logs -> backups 
        - common forensic locations:
            - CPU cache and registers 
                - rarely captured, since most investigations don't need this level of detail 
            - ephemeral data like process table, kernel statistics, ARP cache, etc
                - can be captured through a combo of memory and disk acquisition
                - however, the capture will only be done in the moment the acquisition is done
            - RAM content
                - can be helpful for both investigations and incident response
                - memory can contain encryption keys, ephemeral data from applications, and info that might not be written to disk 
            - swap / pagefile info 
                - like RAM, can provide insight into running processes 
                - since its actively used, it changes quickly 
            - files / data 
                - important to capture entire disk instead of copying files so you can see deleted files and other artifacts that remain 
            - OS 
                - registry is a common target for analysis since many activities in Windows modify / update the registry 
            - devices 
                - phones, tablets, IoT devices, embedded / specialized systems can also contain data 
            - firmware
                - less frequently targeted forensic artifact
                - can be accessible using a hardware interface (USB, serial cable) or via memory forensic techniques 
            - snapshots from VMs
            - network traffic and logs 
            - artifacts like devices, printouts, media, etc 
        - if legal case, important to maintain chain of custody documentation 
            - basically just document every time the drive / device / artifact is accessed or transferred
        - for admissibility in court: 
            - the data must be intact and unaltered and be provably shown to be unaltered
            - analysts must show they have the appropriate skills, they used appropriate tools and techniques, and they've documented their actions 
    - cloud forensics 
        - cloud env considerations
            - right to audit clauses
                - part of contract between cloud service and org
                - this clause provides either ability to audit the cloud provider or agreement to use a third party audit agency 
            - regulatory and jurisdiction concerns 
                - regulatory requirements vary depending on location and HQ 
                - local jurisdiction may claim rights to access data with a search warrant 
            - data breach notif laws
                - vary from country to country / state to state 
                - contracts cover the max time that can elapse before customers are notified 
- acquisition 
    - acquisition tools
        - dd
            - linux cmdline utility that lets you create images
        - FTK Imager
            - free tool for creating forensic images 
            - supports:
                - raw-(dd) style format
                - SMART (ASR Data's format for SMART forensic tool)
                - E01 (EnCase)
                - AFF (Advanced Forensics Format)
                - these are formats commonly used for other forensic tools
            - also supports:
                - physical drives, logical drives, image files, folders, CD/DVD volumes, live memory from a system 
        - WinHex
            - disk editing tool that can also acquire disk images in raw format (and WinHex format)
        - note: sec+ doesn't really focus on specific tools 
        - acquiring network forensic data
            - if network traffic isn't being directly logged, you can use artifacts like firewall logs, IDS / IPS logs, email server logs, auth logs
            - use packet analyzer (like Wireshark) to review network traffic 
    - acquiring forensic data from other sources 
        - VMs
            - VMs are usually running in a shared environment, so removing the system could disrupt other systems / ppl 
            - however, imaging the entire virtualizing host is more data than needed 
            - thus, use VM snapshots 
        - containers
            - containers have less forensic artifacts because they are ephemeral and often use shared resources 
    - validating forensic data integrity 
        - hash it 
        - document the provenance (where an image / drive came from and what happened w/ it) 
            - include info about chain of custody, processes, pictures, written notes
    - data recovery 
        - forensics can be used to recover data from drives / devices 
        - usually, deleting files just deletes it from the drive's file index (and not actually removing the data)
        - slack space: open space with data still there 
    - forensic suites 
        - forensic suites: complete forensic solutions that support forensic data acquisition, analysis, and reporting 
            - ex: FTK, EnCase, Autopsy
- reporting
    - typical forensic report:
        - summary of investigation and findings
        - outline of forensic process (tools used, assumptions made)
        - sections detailing findings / conclusions 
        - recommendations / more conclusions
