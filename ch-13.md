## wireless and mobile security

- connection methods
	- cellular
		- towers cover geographic areas (divided into cells)
		- 5G requires more antenna density but has more bandwidth and throughput
		- provided by cell carrier, so security, management, and control are outside of your org 
	- wifi
		- relies on 2.4GHz and 5GHz radio bands and uses multiple channels within those bands to allow multiple networks to coexist

		- wifi protocols (like WPA2 and WPA3) provide security and functionality for security
		- ad hoc mode:
			- devices can talk to each other directly
		- infrastructure mode:
			- traffic goes through a base station, or access point
		- wifi uses SSIDs for a network name, which can be broadcast or kept private
	- bluetooth
		- in 2.4GHz range 
		- used for low power, short range connections w/o high bandwidth needs 
		- connecting in point to point rather than client server model 
		- 4 security modes
			- mode 1: no security
			- mode 2: service level enforced security (encryption w/ unauthenticated pairing)
			- mode 3: link level enforced security (authenticated pairing w/ encryption)
			- mode 4: standard pairing with Security Simple Pairing (SSP)
		- bluetooth does have encryption but relies on the PIN from both devices 
	- RFID
		- uses short range tags and a receiver to exchange info 
		- tag types
			- active: have their own power source and always send signals to be read 
			- semi-active: have a battery to power their circuits but are activated by the reader
			- passive: entirely powered by the reader
		- they use 1 of 3 frequency ranges 
			- low frequency
				- used for short range, low power tags 
				- usually for entry access and id purposes 
			- high frequency
				- longer readable range (up to 1 meter), can communicate faster
			- ultra high frequency
				- longest range, fastest to read
	- GPS
		- uses constellation of satellites that send out GPS signals, which are received by a GPS receiver
		- helps position devices to within a foot of their actual position
		- also provides consistent time signal
		- usually refers to US GPS system, but there's also Russian GLONASS system and smaller regional systems
		- GPS signals can be jammed or spoofed
	- NFC
		- short range communication, like google pay
	- Infrared
		- only work in line of sight 
- wireless network models 
	- 4 major connection models
		- point to point
			- connects two nodes, transmissions can only be received by the endpoints
		- point to multipoint
			- many nodes receive info sent by a node
		- mesh
		- broadcast
			- send out information on many nodes, don't care about receiving a response 
			- ex: GPS, radio
- attacks against wireless networks and devices
	- evil twins and rogue access pointers
		- evil twin: malicious, illegitimate access point that appears to be a trusted network 
			- if someone connects to the evil twin, the victim's traffic will be captured 
		- rogue access points: APs added to your network (intentional or unintentional)
			- once connected to your network, they can offer a point of entry to attackers 
	- bluetooth attacks
		- bluejacking
			- sends unsolicited messages to bluetooth enabled devices
		- bluesnarfing
			- unauthorized access to a bluetooth device, usually gathering info like contact lists or other details the device contains 
	- RF and protocol attacks 
		- disassociation: when a device disconnects from an AP 
			- to force disassociation, they can send a deauthentication frame, which can be send to the AP by spoofing the victim's wireless MAC address
			- when received, the AP disassociates the device 
			- since management frames on WPA2 networks aren't encrypted, it's pretty easy to conduct this attack 
				- however, WPA3 encrypts management frames
		- jamming: blocking traffic in a range or frequency
	-   sideloading and jailbreaks
		- sideloading: transferring files to a mobile device to install apps outside of official app store
		- jailbreaking: taking advantage of vulns in a mobile device's OS for a privilege escalation and root the system, providing the user with more access 
- designing a network
	- site survey: moving through facility to determine existing networks and look at location options for access points 
		- site survey tools test wireless signal as you walk to build a heatmap 
	- determine which channels your AP will use 
		- in 2.4GHz band, which channel is 20 MHz wide, with a 5 MHz space between
